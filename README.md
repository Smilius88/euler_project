#	Project Euler Solutions		#
#		by Sean Young		#
# 		Updated: 6/22/13	#

These are all scripts which solve Euler Puzzles, published at http://projecteuler.net/. My user name is Smilius (same as this git), and I've currently solved 75 of the puzzles.

I've been working on them for roughly two years now: the Euler puzzles were the first recreation programming I did, and still make up the bulk of my non-school related programming. Its also my primary source of recreational math.

This repository is a work in progress, and is intended to do a few things:

* Document my progress in programming and algorithms.
* Teach me how to use git and verson control.
* Teach me how to use the vim editor, which I'm using right now. 

I'm sure I'll come up with more objectives as I think about this.


# 		Notes and Goals		#	

* Many of these programs were written when I was just beginning programming and don't reflect my current abilities. I'm going to rewrite them and pretty them up. I don't know when most of these scripts were written, either. 
  
* Just because there isn't a solution in the repo doesn't mean I haven't solved it. Some of these problems were solved from the interpreter interface. I'll be adding solutions to solved problems  periodically. A newly added program doesn't mean that it's a new solution.

* Not all of the files here are complete. Some are just code fragments that I used on the command line when I was playing with the problem. Some are attempts that failed. Some are just broken. Very few indeed are commented -- which is a shame, since half the fun is that math required to get a solution.  I'll fix all that progressively. 

* There are a bunch of helper functions strewn about in different files. My current preferred utility library is 'isprime.py'. I'll be eliminating these files as I come across them.  

* The repo itself is pretty messsy, since I just created it and am still getting the hang of git. 

* I've made sure to document code that's not mine. Mostly to keep from getting a false sense of superiority.

#	Favorites!	#

Somewhat arbitrarily:

euler56.py: I think this was the frist oneliner I wrote, back when I discovered list comprehension. I love a good one liner.

euler75.py: My algorithm for finding right triangles with a given perimeter is efficient, and the math is neat. 

euler82.py: Shortest path from one side of a matrix to the other.  I like this one mostly because I came puzzled out the algorithm without doing any research, just wrote it out in a bar one night.
